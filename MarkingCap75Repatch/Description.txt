Old patch MarkingAndPositioningClampTo75 which was designed to fix 2 major bugs in the original game: Positioning and Marking in match values calculation integer overflow.
Unfortunately the patch itself contains a bug. Specifically the fix designed for Marking is applied by mistake to Off The Ball.
This new patch MarkingCap75Repatch fixes the issue. It can must applied after MarkingAndPositioningClampTo75.patch.
